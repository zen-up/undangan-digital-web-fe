## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Setting Up Environment Variables

To configure your Nuxt development environment, ensure you create a `.env` file in the root of your project.

### Using .env.example

It is recommended to use a `.env.example` file to serve as a template for environment variables in your project. This helps developers understand which variables are needed.

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:8000` (or based on the `NUXT_DEVELOPMENT_PORT` value in your `.env` file).

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

## Versioning

### Committing Changes

To ensure consistency in commits, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm commit
```

This will guide you through a structured commit message following Conventional Commits.
